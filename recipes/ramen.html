    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle soup known for its rich, savory broth
      and endless customization options. This dish typically features wheat
      noodles served in a flavorful broth, topped with proteins like sliced pork
      (chashu), soft-boiled eggs, and an assortment of vegetables and
      seasonings. Ingredients for a basic ramen include ramen noodles, chicken
      or pork stock, soy sauce, miso paste, garlic, ginger, green onions,
      mushrooms, nori (seaweed), a soft-boiled egg, and sliced pork or tofu for
      vegetarians.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare ramen, start by making the broth. Combine chicken or pork stock
      with soy sauce, miso paste, grated garlic, and ginger in a pot, and let it
      simmer for 30 minutes to develop a rich flavor. Cook the ramen noodles
      according to the package instructions and drain them. In a serving bowl,
      arrange the noodles and pour the hot broth over them. Top with sliced pork
      or tofu, soft-boiled eggs, sliced mushrooms, chopped green onions, and a
      piece of nori. Serve hot, and feel free to add a sprinkle of sesame seeds
      or chili oil for extra flavor.
