    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavor and
      satisfying textures. To prepare a classic lasagna, start by making a
      robust meat sauce. Sauté diced onions and garlic in olive oil until
      fragrant, then add ground beef or Italian sausage and cook until browned.
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of Italian herbs like
      basil, oregano, and thyme. Simmer the sauce to deepen the flavors. For an
      added touch, incorporate a splash of red wine or a pinch of red pepper
      flakes for heat. While the sauce cooks, prepare the cheese filling by
      combining ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, an egg, and freshly chopped
      parsley in a bowl.

      To assemble, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking
      dish, followed by a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles. Top the noodles
      with a portion of the ricotta mixture, then sprinkle shredded mozzarella
      cheese over it. Repeat the layering process until all ingredients are
      used, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.
      Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for
      about 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15
      minutes to achieve a bubbly, golden crust. Allow the lasagna to rest for
      10-15 minutes before slicing to ensure neat layers. This timeless recipe
      is perfect for family dinners or special occasions, offering a comforting
      meal that's as delicious as it is satisfying.
